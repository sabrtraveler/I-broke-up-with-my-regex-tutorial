# Tutorial: Regex matching Hex value

Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. In a regular expression the metacharacter ^ means "not". So, while "a" means "match lowercase a", "^a" means "do not match lowercase a".

## Summary

Today I will be covering and breaking down the components of a regular expression used to match Hex Values. Hexadecimal code is a system by which any specific color can be described accurately to a computer, ensuring consistency and accuracy in an electronic display. A hexadecimal color value is a six-digit code preceded by a # sign; it defines a color that is used in a website or a computer program.
/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/

## Regex Components

### Anchors

/`^`#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})`$`/  
Anchors are a different breed. They do not match any character at all. Instead, they match a position before, after, or between characters. They can be used to “anchor” the regex match at a certain position. The caret `^` matches the position before the first character in the string. Applying `^a` to `abc` matches `a`. `^b` does not match `abc` at all, because the `b` cannot be matched right after the start of the string, matched by `^`. See below for the inside view of the regex engine.
Similarly, `$` matches right after the last character in the string. `c$` matches `c` in `abc`, while `a$` does not match at all.

### Quantifiers

/^#`?`([a-f0-9]`{6}`|[a-f0-9]`{3}`)$/  
Quantifiers are used to communicate how many characters are expected. Quantifiers specify how many instances of a character, group, or character class must be present in the input for a match to be found. By default, quantifiers are greedy, and will match as many characters as possible. If the "`,+,?,{}`" characters are found within regular expressions, they are considered quantifiers. The `?` indicates the expression to match `0` or `1`time. As mentioned in the summary above because there are 2 types of formats we'll use the or operator to distinguish which format we are using. In our Hex Value regular expression we have `{6}` (Hex Triplet Format) and `{3}` (Shorthand Hex Format), this indicates that the length of the component preceding these quantifiers should be `6` for `{6}` and `3` for `{3}`.

### OR Operator

/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}`|`[a-f0-9]{3})$/  
The "or" operator within a regular expression is defined using the `|` element. The or operator indicates that it could either of the components that we are separating with the `|`. For our hex value regular expression we have ` ([a-f0-9]{6}``|``[a-f0-9]{3}) `. Note the or operator separating these 2 components. This means that our hex value could either be 6 characters `[a-f0-9]{6}` or 3 characters `[a-f0-9]{3}`.

### Character Classes

/^#?(`[a-f0-9]`{6}|`[a-f0-9]{3}`)$/  
Character classes are components within our regular expression that tells us what type of characters to expect. In our example our character classes are confined within brackets `[]`. For our example we have 2 character classes: `[a-f0-9]` and `[a-f0-9]` which searches for the same values. We will be breaking down what the characters are searching within these character classes. `a-f` searches for letters `a-f` and `0-9` searches for digits `0-9`.

### Bracket Expressions

/^#?`([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})`$/  
Matches any character in the square brackets. For example `[nN]` `[oO]` matches `no`, `nO`, `No`, and `NO`.
`gr[ae]y` matches both spellings of the word `'grey'`; that is, `gray` and `grey`.

### Greedy and Lazy Match

/^#`?`([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/  
A greedy match tries to match an element as many times as possible. Whereas, a lazy match tries to match an element as few times as possible. In our example we have `?` which signifies lazy quantifier. This is referred to a lazy quantifier because it causes the regular expression engine to match as few occurances as possible. We can simply turn this lazy match into a greedy one by adding a `?`.
